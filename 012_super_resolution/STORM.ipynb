    "**Notice** You need CUQIpy-PyTorch to run this notebook.\n",

    "In this case study, we perform uncertainty quantification for stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). STORM is a super-resolution microscopy method based on single-molecule stochastic switching, where the goal is to detect molecule positions in live cell imaging. The image is obtained by a microscope detecting the photon count of the (fluorescence) photoactivated molecules. The original problem is solved in [1] by a deterministic method. In [2], uncertainty quantification is carried out in the Bayesian context. This notebook reimplements the methodology of [2] using CUQIpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplace priors offer an appealing choice in Bayesian inference due to their ability to promote sparsity and handle heavy-tailed distributions. However, their application in high-dimensional inverse problems becomes increasingly challenging.  As the dimensionality of the parameter space grows, the performance of traditional sampling methods employed for Bayesian inference deteriorates significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this obstacle, this work proposes a novel approach that combines the method of Certified Coordinate Selection (CCS) with a gradient-based sampling method. CCS allows us to efficiently identify the components in the unknown that contribute most to the update from the prior to the posterior, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem considered during inference. This enables the gradient-based sampling method to perform efficiently even in high-dimensional settings."

However, a few values converge to higher extremes, highlighting regions where the signal is present. This contrast effectively captures the underlying structure of the image, demonstrating the ability of the Laplace prior in promoting sparsity in signals.\n",

The smoothed Laplace prior ensures that the solution remains sparse and interpretable, the reduced likelihood keeps the computational demands manageable, and NUTS guarantees robust and efficient exploration of the posterior distribution. Together, these methods enable the precise reconstruction of the signal.\n",
